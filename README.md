# fuck
Take your frustrations out on your terminal...but it might not take it so kindly.

## But why?
Whenever I close my terminal, or shut down my laptop, it a lot of times is out of frustration. In my head, I think "Fuck this," and then give up and close or shutdown.

So I made a script that lets you TYPE `fuck this`, and it'll crash your terminal. Actually speaking or typing something is the best way to vent frustration.

Nice.

Otherwise, are you mad at the terminal itself? No problem! Tell it  `fuck you` or to `fuck off`, and it'll shutdown your computer for you! Brilliant!

Or, say `fuck me`, and...it'll help you out with that a bit.

But let's be honest, if you have the time to use this script you *probably* aren't using Tinder. So, just type `fuck myself` and let your hand handle your frustration. ;)

## No, seriously, why?
I don't know. Stop asking me. It's annoying. `fuck you`.

## Install globally...for some reason.
Run `./install.sh` or to install without fetching from GitHub run `./install.sh -nu`.

## Usage
`fuck this | you | off | me`
